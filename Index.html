        <p>Mixed drinks called punch were being made as far back as the 1500s, but the invention of the cocktail
            itself can be traced to the 1800s. The word “cocktail” was first published in a newspaper in 1806, but
            the first publication of a bartenders’ guide which included cocktail recipes came in 1862, titled How to
            Mix Drinks; or, The Bon Vivant’s Companion, by “Professor” Jerry Thomas. The book is still a standard
            reference work today as the recipes are still used all over the world. Along with recipes for punches,
            sours, slings, cobblers, shrubs, toddies, flips, and a variety of other mixed drinks are ten recipes for
            “cocktails”.</p>

        <p>The first cocktail party was hosted by Mrs. Julius S. Walsh Jr. of St. Louis, Missouri, in May 1917. She
            is said to have invited fifty guests to her home at noon on a Sunday. The party apparently lasted an
            hour, until lunch was served at 1pm. The site of this party still stands today. In 1924, the Roman
            Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis bought the mansion and it has served as the local archbishop’s
            residence since.</p>

        <p>United States’ Prohibition lasted from 1919 to1933 and because alcoholic beverages became illegal,
            cocktails were consumed illegally in establishments known as “speakeasies”. The quality of liquor
            available during Prohibition was much worse than before and there was a shift from whiskey to gin
            because it does not require aging, making it easier to produce illicitly. In that period, honey, fruit
            juices, and other flavourings were used to mask the foul taste of the inferior liquors. Sweet cocktails
            were easier to drink quickly, which was ideal because the establishment might be raided at any moment.</p>

        <p>By the late 1960s and through the 1970s, cocktails became less popular until rising again in the 1980s
            with vodka often used in place of the original gin in drinks such as the martini. The standard cocktails
            began to make a comeback in the early 2000s, and by the mid-2000s there was a renaissance of cocktail
            culture in a style we now call mixology that draws on classic cocktails for inspiration but utilizes
            novel ingredients and often complex flavours.</p>

        <p>Traditionally, what we referred to as a cocktail was a mixture of spirits, sugar, water, and bitters.
            The key ingredient separating cocktails from other drinks in Thomas’ book was the use of bitters.
            Popular mixed drinks of today which conform to this original meaning of “cocktail” include the Old
            Fashioned whiskey cocktail and the Manhattan cocktail.</p>

        <p>Cocktails have featured in most aspects of our popular culture, if not all. Some cocktails have even
            come to exist as a result of them. In film and literature most especially, we have a long list of these
            cocktails including the Vesper Martini, Jack Rose, Whiskey Sour, Scotch Mist, 7&7, May Queen, Rob Roy,
            Flaming Moe, Singapore Sling, French 75 and so on.</p>
