            <p>Mixed drinks called punch were being made as far back as the 1500s, but the invention of the cocktail
                itself can be traced to the 1800s. The word “cocktail” was first published in a newspaper in 1806, but
                the first publication of a bartenders’ guide which included cocktail recipes came in 1862, titled How to
                Mix Drinks; or, The Bon Vivant’s Companion, by “Professor” Jerry Thomas. The book is still a standard
                reference work today as the recipes are still used all over the world. Along with recipes for punches,
                sours, slings, cobblers, shrubs, toddies, flips, and a variety of other mixed drinks are ten recipes for
                “cocktails”.</p>

            <p>United States’ Prohibition lasted from 1919 to1933 and because alcoholic beverages became illegal,
                cocktails were consumed illegally in establishments known as “speakeasies”. The quality of liquor
                available during Prohibition was much worse than before and there was a shift from whiskey to gin
                because it does not require aging, making it easier to produce illicitly. In that period, honey, fruit
                juices, and other flavourings were used to mask the foul taste of the inferior liquors. Sweet cocktails
                were easier to drink quickly, which was ideal because the establishment might be raided at any moment.
            </p>

            <p>By the late 1960s and through the 1970s, cocktails became less popular until rising again in the 1980s
                with vodka often used in place of the original gin in drinks such as the martini. The standard cocktails
                began to make a comeback in the early 2000s, and by the mid-2000s there was a renaissance of cocktail
                culture in a style we now call mixology that draws on classic cocktails for inspiration but utilizes
                novel ingredients and often complex flavours.</p>

            <p>Traditionally, what we referred to as a cocktail was a mixture of spirits, sugar, water, and bitters.
                The key ingredient separating cocktails from other drinks in Thomas’ book was the use of bitters.
                Popular mixed drinks of today which conform to this original meaning of “cocktail” include the Old
                Fashioned whiskey cocktail and the Manhattan cocktail.</p>

            <p>Cocktails have featured in most aspects of our popular culture, if not all. Some cocktails have even
                come to exist as a result of them. In film and literature most especially, we have a long list of these
                cocktails including the Vesper Martini, Jack Rose, Whiskey Sour, Scotch Mist, 7&7, May Queen, Rob Roy,
                Flaming Moe, Singapore Sling, French 75 and so on.</p>
